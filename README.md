# Bankist-Mock-Bank-Website
A website with dynamic and responsive animations, for the mock bank "Bankist".

Created with the Udemy course by Jonas Schmedtmann, this helped teach me 
how to allow smooth scrolling, and smooth transitions of fields appearing and disappearing
how to create a picture slider with scroll buttton and keyboard functionality.
Event delegation
Setting up event listeners on parent elements to reduce multiple event listener for sibling elements
Responsive menu bar's visibility dependant on mouse movement
how to make the navigation bar "sticky" and always remain at the top of the browser's viewable area when vertical scrolling
